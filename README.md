## Open Source Proyect
Because this is an *open source* proyect you can download the information in this repository so you can add features to the program and do your own app. There is a [portal](http://www.pinturillo2.com/) for you can upload your animations. 

## Where to download
There is the first App we made that you migth download in the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/mx/app/clash-royale/id1053012308?mt=8) and in the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kaxangames.tacomaster&hl=es_419).

## How to work with
### Unity
This is proyect was made with **Unity in the version 2017.3.1f1** and using **Vuforia**.

* So you can work properly you need to download the [installer](https://store.unity.com/es/download) of Unity.

</p>

* After you download it you need to run it and accept the License Agreement.
* The next step is to select what packages of Unity you want, you will install in this point Vuforia, in case you do not install any of the need it packages you migth not worry you can do it later running the installer again and just select the ones you forgot. You will select the ones in the picture so it may see like thiss your window, we recommend not to install other packages in case you have worked with Unity before.

* The best way to introduce you in AR with **Vuforia** is to see their [tutorial](https://library.vuforia.com/articles/Solution/ground-plane-guide.html) for beginners.



### Animations

* For our app we made the models in **Maya**, but because is the modeling you can use whatever it can export the models to **Unity**.
